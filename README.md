This is the main plugin that I made for my anarchy server and I thought I would make it open source.   
For now the plugin is not configurable but I will add support for that in the future

### Features
- Patches
  - Anti illegals (removes unobtainable items and reverts illegal enchantments)
  - Anti nether roof (similar to void damage)
  - Boatfly patch
  - Elytrafly patch (normal ely fly still works)
- Commands
  - Discord
  - Help
  - Joindate
  - Kill
  - Stats (shows server age, size, number of unique players who joined and RAM usage)
- Misc
  - Random respawn
  - Armor stand limiter (to prevent lag)
  - Custom tab (shows uptime, TPS, ping, number of players and a MOTD)
- Chat
  - Custom join and death message
  - Greentext (put '>' before your message)
  - LGBT text (put '$[g,t,b,p,n,l]' before your message)
  - Advanced anti spam (blocks spam that contains random strings as well)
   
   
#### More features will be added soon.
